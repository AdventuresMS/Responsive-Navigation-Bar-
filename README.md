A navigation bar (navbar) is a key element in web design that helps users navigate between different sections or pages of a website. This guide outlines how to create a responsive navigation bar using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity

A navigation bar is essential for guiding users through your website. You can build one using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

HTML: Set up the navbar with a logo, links, and a hamburger menu for mobile.
CSS: Style the navbar using Flexbox for layout, and ensure it's responsive by adjusting the design for smaller screens.
JavaScript: Add interactivity by toggling the menu visibility when the hamburger icon is clicked.
This approach results in a clean, functional, and responsive navigation bar that enhances user experience on all devices.
